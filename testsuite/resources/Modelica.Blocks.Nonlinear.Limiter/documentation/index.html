<p> <i>Limit the range of a signal</i> </p> 
<h4> <u> Information </u> </h4><html>
<p>
The Limiter block passes its input signal as output signal
as long as the input is within the specified upper and lower
limits. If this is not the case, the corresponding limits are passed
as output.
</p>
<p>
The parameter <code>homotopyType</code> in the Advanced tab specifies the
simplified behaviour if homotopy-based initialization is used:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>NoHomotopy</code>: the actual expression with limits is used</li>
<li><code>Linear</code>: a linear behaviour y = u is assumed (default option)</li>
<li><code>UpperLimit</code>: it is assumed that the output is stuck at the upper limit u = uMax</li>
<li><code>LowerLimit</code>: it is assumed that the output is stuck at the lower limit u = uMin</li>
</ul>
<p>
If it is known a priori in which region the input signal will be located, this option can help
a lot by removing one strong nonlinearity from the initialization problem.
