#DESCRIPTION#
This function can be called in different model states:

- Before instantiation: `setReal` can be used to set start values or to define
  initial unknowns (e.g. parameters, states). The values are not immediately
  applied to the simulation unit, since it isnâ€™t actually instantiated.
- After instantiation and before initialization: Same as before instantiation,
  but the values are applied immediately to the simulation unit.
- After initialization: Can be used to force external inputs, which might cause
  discrete changes of continuous signals.
