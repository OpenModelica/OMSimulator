Introduction
============

The OMSimulator project is a FMI-based co-simulation tool. It supports
large-scale simulation and virtual prototyping using models from
multiple sources utilizing the FMI standard. It is integrated into
OpenModelica but also available stand-alone, i.e., without
dependencies to Modelica specific models or technology. OMSimulator
provides an industrial-strength open-source FMI-based modelling and
simulation tool. Input/output ports of FMUs can be connected, ports
can be grouped to buses, FMUs can be parameterized and composed, and
composite models can be exported according to the SSP (System
Structure and Parameterization) standard. Efficient FMI based
simulation is provided for both model-exchange and co-simulation. An
external API is available for use from other tools and scripting
languages such as :ref:`Python <oms-python>` and :ref:`Lua <oms-lua>`.
